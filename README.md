## About the project
This is a Node.js application that uses Sequelize, MySQL and Express to build a database for e-commerce usage and storage.

The database is organized and executed using three different models: Categories, Products, and Tags. Using Express and Insomnia, users are able to retreive different products, categories or tags by entering the according endpoints.
